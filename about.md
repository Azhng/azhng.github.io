### Hi! I'm Archer Zhang (azhng). 

I am a developer, a craftsman, a judoka and a student with endless curiousity.

I am interested various topics of Computer Science including Î»-calculus, type theories, distributed systems and graphics. I am currently focusing on learning about foundation of computer graphics by building a [graphics engine](https://github.com/azhng/glex) that support dynamic lighting, ray tracing and phyics. I am also the author of [fantastic-kit](https://github.com/fantastic-kit/fantastic-kit), a command line tool that increases developer's productivity.

I have previously interned at [Shopify](https://twitter.com/shopifyeng) and [Dessa](https://dessa.com). I just wrapped up my summer internship at [Google](https://google.com) and will be back at Waterloo for my 3B term for the fall.

If I'm in Waterloo, there's a very high probability that you will find me in [UW CSC](https://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/) office. Feel free to come by and say hi if you are ever nearby.
