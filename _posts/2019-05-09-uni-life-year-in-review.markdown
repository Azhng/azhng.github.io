So it has been almost two years since my last blog post and I have to admit this one is definitely long overdue.
But between all the school works and job hunting, it just felt like I never had the time and mental energy to sit down and reflect on what had happened in the past two years. 
And I have to admit, it's getting more and more difficult to recall everything that has happened in the last two years.
Memories that were once clear are now blurry and confusing.
Though I am not entirely sure if this has something to do with my increasing consumption of alcohol over the years.


Anyways, a lot had happened in the past two years.
Some of them were good, some of them were bad and some of them were really ugly.
But here we are, two years later, at least still in one piece. So I guess that's somewhat a good sign.
One thing definitely remained the same over the course of these two years is my horrible writing skills.
This document has remained open in my laptop for almost 2 weeks before I began writing down the first sentence.
And of course, that's after drinking almost half bottle of wine.
Welp, alcohol is a very interesting thing for sure ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

# School

School has always been kind of hit and miss.
Overall, the amount of the course load and stress grow roughly at O(n) rate every semester.
Though luckily, the amount of support I got from my friends was growing at O(n^2).
Here's a funny thing with human memories:
it is way better at retaining the great and awesome moments than the bad ones.

The CS courses that I have been taking have definitely become more and more interesting, especially some of the third and fourth year courses.
Some of the best and most fun courses I have taken were: CS 241E Enriched Compiler, CS 246E Enriched OOP, CS 442 Programming Language.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that experience with these courses vary greatly depending on the professor that is teaching it during that term,
and I was lucky enough to have some of the best CS professors in the faculty.

### [CS 241E](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241e/)
The content of the CS 241E was fairly standard introduction to the general compiler constructs,
including parsing, tokenization, DFA/NFAs, code generation and garbage collection.
However, this course was my first introduction to Scala, one of my favorite programming langauges til this day.
It was taught by [Ondřej Lhoták](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~olhotak/),
and Ondřej was one of the few professors that I met who actually does care about his students.
I remember once after I spent two days desperately trying to debug a weird issue of my compiler, I came to Ondřej for help.
He actually sat down and spend hours running through my code on his own laptop trying to find the bug. 

### [CS 246E](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs246e/)
When I first took this course, it was the first time this course was offered.
This course was taught by [Brad Lushman](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~bmlushma/).
CS 246E is, without any doubt, the course with the heaviest course load among all CS courses that I have taken.
I am not sure if it was designed to be like that or it was simply because it was the first time it was offered.
I remember for the final project of the course, I spent almost two weeks sleeping in MC Comfy (a very sketchy part of UWaterloo) trying to finish it.
I was only able to go home in the morning when I woke up to take a shower.
However, this was also the course where I developed my special emotional attachment to Vim because it is exactly the final project of this course:
implementing Vim.
I have tried so many times to move off Vim to Emacs or other IDEs/text editors so many times,
none of my attempts succeeded.

So, was the course worth it? 
HELL YEAH.
The most significant characteristic of Brad's courses is he tries to shovel as much content as possible into a single course.
And during lectures, he has always been able to somehow present it in the way that is digestible by a regular student.
But does that mean it is enjoyable? NO!
Nevertheless, the difference between the level of understanding I had for C++ before and after I took the course was like night and day.
Brad took us from the surface of the world of C++ to its darkness corners.

### [CS 442](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs442/)
This course was my third encounter with Brad Lushman in less than two years and I was not really sure should I be happy or sad.
On one hand Brad was indeed a really great prof, but on the other hand I was still scarred by one of the midterm exams of his courses earlier.
It was absolutely brutal exam and it was probably my single biggest L until I had my CS 341 midterm.

Jokes aside, CS 442 was hands down the best CS course I have taken so far.
It covered the very fundemental constructs of programming language in great details.
The main topics of this course include lambda calculus, type system, type inference, logical programming and formal sementics.
The OOP part of the course was a bit meh but this was mainly because Brad fast tracked it since most of the people in class were already familiar with it.
Though this course didn't make me obsessed with creating my own programming language like my friend [@Dhruv Jauhar](https://github.com/Dhruv-Jauhar),
it still made me to start to rethink what makes a great programming language.


### Other CS courses and a disclaimer

CS 241E/CS 246E/CS 442 were the three of my favorite courses in past two years.
Other CS courses that were not listed were not necessary bad courses, in fact most of them were quite enjoyable depending on who is teaching.
However, this is not a review of all the courses I have taken in UW.
[uwflow.com](https://uwflow.com/) is definitely a way better source for that purpose.

### Other Non-CS/Math courses

I haven't taken much Non-CS/Math courses in past two years. But for the ones that I have taken, the only review I can give is: ***Meh***.
